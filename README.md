## Description

This webpage acts as a to-do list. From the home page, users are able to select whether they want to view their list or add a new item to the list. If they click add a new item, they're taken to a page with a form where they're able to enter a new item and submit. Once submitted, the item is added as a bullet point on the to-do list. They can then choose from there if they'd like to add another item or not. If they navigate back to the home page, users are able to click the link to see the list. If there's no items on the list yet, they're returned a message that says so. If there is items, their full list is displayed back to them.
